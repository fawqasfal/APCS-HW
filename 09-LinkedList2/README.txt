wait im not sure what youre asking here
empty set is 0? 
what about a set with 1 element that is 0? how do i distinguish that?
if you replace "null" with "0", does that mean that
if 0 shows up in the middle of the set, i should just call that a 'gap' in the set and stop counting there? 
what if i want 0 in the middle of the set? 
what if i delete that 0? [] == [0]? or [0] is regarded as empty, but [] is not? 
what if its not a set that works with primitives/object version of primitives?

or do you just mean that if one would call the constructor with no args, just make a 1-elem'd set with 0?  again with the type problem
