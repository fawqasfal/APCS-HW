Stack from classcode, reimplemented to use arrays instead of arraylists.

Wait is it cheating if I used MyList, which is basically ArrayList except shittier cause I wrote it, but still legitimate because … I wrote it? It’s basically a class for handling growing/decreasing in size and generic types ?
