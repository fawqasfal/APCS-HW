Stack from classcode, reimplemented to use arrays instead of arraylists.

Unsure of what we were supposed to do seeing as the code you put doesn't use ArrayLists and from the lesson plan I assumed we had to take ArrayLists 
and convert them to Arrays.

i have an old java file from a term ago that involved turning array -> arraylist that lets the array grow and decrease in size.
